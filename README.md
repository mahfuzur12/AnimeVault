# AnimeVault

AnimeVault is a simple anime app built with React where you can search through different animes and favourite your top picks. This project was created while learning React and its key concepts. It serves as a fun way to discover and keep track of your favourite anime series.

**Deployed App:** [AnimeVault](https://anime-vault-app.netlify.app/)

## 🚀 Features

### 🔍 Search for Animes
Search for a wide variety of animes and explore their details.

### ⭐ Favourite Animes
Keep track of your favourite animes by adding them to your favourites list.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **Components**: Creating and managing reusable components in React.
- **useState**: Managing state within components.
- **Page Routing**: Using React Router for navigation between different pages.
- **CSS Styling**: Applying styles using standard CSS (not Tailwind).
- **Calling APIs**: The app uses the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/) to fetch anime data.
- **useEffect**: Handling side effects like fetching data when the component mounts.
- **Contexts**: Managing global variables (data that can be accessed across multiple components). Contexts allow you to share state or functions globally in your app, without passing props down manually at every level.
